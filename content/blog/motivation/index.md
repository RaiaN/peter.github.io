Why would someone need a technical blog in 2019? Everything is written, everything is said, you say.

I think this place is especially usefull when I am digging into fields of programming that I am not familiar with and want to try out some R&D.

I will start this blog with series of articles about Unreal Engine 4 and C++ in the game development context. Reason is simple: these are the technologies I work with most often nowadays. 

Happy reading!
