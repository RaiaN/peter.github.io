Why would someone need a technical blog in 2019? Everything is written, everything is said, you say.

I think this place will be especially usefull when I decide to try out some programming R&D with undefined result.

I will start this blog with series of articles about Unreal Engine 4 and C++ in the context of game development. Reason is simple: these are the technologies I work with most often nowadays. 

Happy reading!
